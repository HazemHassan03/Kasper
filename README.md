A responsive landing page I developed using HTML and CSS.

The page contains 7 sections ( landing, services, portfolio, about, testimonials and skills, pricing, and contact ).

The project is 100% responsive on all devices using Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries. 

It has a button that takes you to the top of the page. 

Also, I changed the styles of the scroll bar to be suitable for the design of the page. 

Prevent some hovers on touch devices.
